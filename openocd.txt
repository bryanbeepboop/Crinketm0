# SAMD runs at SYSCLK = 1 MHz divided from RC oscillator after reset.
# Other members of family usually use SYSCLK = 4 MHz after reset.
# Datasheet does not specify SYSCLK to SWD clock ratio.
# Usually used SYSCLK/6 is slow, testing shows that debugging can
# work @ SYSCLK/2 but your mileage may vary.
# This limit is most probably imposed by incorrectly handled SWD WAIT
# on some SWD adapters.
